Answer: Yes

Summary of the collaboration policy and rationale:
Answer: The collaboration policy makes it so that students in CS15 can discuss overarching topics that are covered
in class, but not specific elements of assignments. For homework, students can speak with one another about conceptual
ideas such as class structure/organization, but not look at each other's code or code from a previous year. For labs
and design sections, students are allowed to work with their lab partners, but not collaborate with other students.
During conceptual hours, you're allowed to work with other students, but not show each other code or discuss the
specifics of it in any capacity. Students are, however, allowed to discuss any course material that's covered in lecture
with each other outside of lecture. The reason why this collaboration policy exists is because CS15 does not have
tests and quizzes, meaning projects are the only way that we can be assessed. If we're working with other students and
not actually completing the projects to the best of our own ability, we aren't really learning anything at all.
